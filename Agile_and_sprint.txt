 Agile
 
"What is the Agile Manifesto , and how does it differ from traditional 
project management methods?" 
The Agile Manifesto is a foundational document introduced in 2001 by a group of 
software development experts . It marked a major shift in how projects are 
managed—especially in software development—by promoting a more flexible  ,
 adaptive , and customer-centered approach compared to traditional , rigid methods 
like the Waterfall model. 
The Agile Manifesto is a mindset that emphasizes: 
• Adapting to change quickly 
• Strong collaboration and communication 
• Delivering real value to the customer rapidly 
• Reducing unnecessary bureaucracy 
In contrast, traditional methods rely on rigid planning and centralized control, 
making them less adaptable to change. 
 
 

"What problems were the software industry trying to solve?" 
Problems the software industry was trying to solve: 
1. Software Complexity: Large programs became hard to understand and 
manage. 
2. Bugs and Errors: Many programs contained errors affecting performance. 
3. Budget and Schedule Overruns: Projects often took longer and cost more 
than expected. 
4. Difficulty Adapting to Change: Modifying software after development was 
challenging. 
5. Low Code Reusability: Much code was rewritten for each project instead of 
being reused. 
6. Maintenance Challenges: Maintaining older software was expensive and 
complex. 
7. Team Collaboration Issues: Large teams struggled to coordinate work and 
track changes. 
 
 
 
 

 
"Compare Agile and Waterfall in detail in terms of: Planning, Handling 
Changes, Customer Involvement, Product Delivery, Risk Management, 
and Documentation."

When should we use Agile and when should we use Waterfall? 
Give three scenarios for each 
When to use Agile: 
Agile is suitable when the project is flexible, has changing requirements, and 
requires continuous customer interaction. 
Scenarios: 
1. Developing a modern web or mobile application: 
a. Requirements may change quickly based on user or market needs. 
b. Continuous updates are needed after each release. 
2. Innovative or experimental projects: 
a. The project scope is not fully defined at the start, and risks are high. 
b. The team needs to experiment with ideas and adapt quickly. 
3. Software requiring incremental delivery to the customer: 
a. The customer wants to see parts of the product and provide feedback 
before the full completion. 
b. Example: SaaS platforms or products needing continuous UX 
improvement. 
When to use Waterfall: 
Waterfall is suitable when the project is well-defined, has stable requirements, and 
changes are unlikely. 
Scenarios: 
1. Government or banking systems with strict standards: 
a. Requirements are clear from the start, and changes are costly. 
b. Example: Payroll systems or banking payment systems. 
2. Engineering or industrial projects (e.g., aviation, automotive): 
a. Mistakes can be costly or unsafe, so full documentation and precise 
steps are required. 
3. Small projects or short-term applications with fixed requirements: 
a. No major changes expected; final delivery is done in one batch. 
b. Example: Static company website or a simple accounting system 


Explain the concept of Continuous Delivery in Agile . How is it different from 
delivering the product only at the end of the project? What are its benefits for 
the client and the team 
1. What is Continuous Delivery (CD)? 
Continuous Delivery is a software development practice that ensures the product is 
always in a deployable state. 
2. Difference between Continuous Delivery and End-of-Project Delivery 
Aspect Continuous Delivery End-of-Project 
Delivery 
Timing Continuous, after each 
change 
Only at the end 
Client 
Feedback 
Immediate, ongoing Only at the end 
Risk Low, small changes High, errors appear late 
Flexibility High, easy to adjust Low, hard to change 
 
3. Benefits of Continuous Delivery 
For the Client: 
1. Sees product improvements continuously. 
2. Can provide early feedback to guide development. 
3. Reduces risk, as the product is always functional and stable. 
For the Team: 
1. Detects bugs early before they become serious. 
2. Increases productivity and flexibility. 
3. Improves product quality due to automated testing. 
4. Reduces pressure at the final release, as work is incremental.

What is a cross-functional team? Why is this concept important in Agile? How 
does it differ from the traditional role-based team structure? 
A cross-functional team has all the skills needed to complete a project from start to 
finish without relying on other teams. 
Importance in Agile: fast delivery, better collaboration, adaptability, and shared 
ownership. 
Difference from traditional teams: 
• Cross-functional: all skills in one team, flexible, fast, shared responsibility. 
• Traditional: separate specialized teams, dependent on others, slower, split 
responsibility. 
 
 

 
What does “Change Embrace” mean? How does Agile handle changing 
requirements during development? Give a practical example. 
Change Embrace means accepting change and seeing it as an opportunity for 
improvement rather than an obstacle. 
How Agile handles changing requirements: 
• Development is incremental, in small parts. 
• Priorities are reviewed regularly in each Sprint. 
• Continuous communication with the client allows changes to be incorporated 
quickly. 
• Frequent delivery enables adaptation without disrupting the project. 
Practical example: 
 A team is developing a shopping app. During a Sprint, the client requests adding 
cryptocurrency payment. The team updates the backlog and implements this feature 
in the next Sprint without delaying other features. 
 
 
 

 
Choose a system or application you know (e.g., delivery app, shopping 
website, booking system) and assume it is developed using Agile: 
• How is the work divided? 
• How are feature priorities handled? 
• How does the client participate in development? 
• What are the benefits of using Agile? 
Work Division: 
• A cross-functional team (developers, designers, QA, product owner). 
• Application split into small features for each Sprint (user accounts, shopping 
cart, payment, etc.). 
Feature Priorities: 
• A product backlog lists all features and priorities. 
• Backlog is reviewed and updated each Sprint based on value and client 
requests. 
Client Participation: 
• Attends Sprint Reviews and provides feedback. 
• Monitors incremental releases to ensure requirements are met. 
Benefits of Agile: 
• Faster delivery and higher flexibility. 
• Better quality and increased client satisfaction. 
• Motivated team with full ownership of the product.

 "What is the importance of short
 them? What are their benefits? And what are the main types?"
 Why We Need Short, Regular Meetings 
• Improve communication: Everyone knows what others are working on. 
• Identify problems early: Obstacles can be solved quickly before they escalate. 
• Increase transparency and accountability: Every team member shares 
progress and responsibilities. 
• Faster decision-making: Discuss key issues without delays. 
Benefits 
• Save time through short meetings (usually 15 minutes). 
• Focus only on what’s important. 
• Enhance collaboration and team support. 
• Increase flexibility to adjust plans quickly. 
• Improve team satisfaction and engagement. 
Common Types of Short Agile Meetings 
• Daily Stand-up: Update progress and discuss daily obstacles. 
• Sprint Planning: Define sprint goals and tasks to be completed. 
• Sprint Review: Review achievements and gather stakeholder feedback. 
• Sprint Retrospective: Evaluate performance and plan for improvements. 
• Backlog Refinement: Prepare and improve backlog items for the next sprint. 
 
 
 

 
List six main benefits of using Agile with practical examples for each. 
1. Adaptability to Change – Agile allows easy adjustment of priorities 
 Example: Adding a new feature to an app during the project. 
2. Improved Product Quality – Delivering and testing small increments reduces 
errors. 
 Example: Running unit tests after each sprint. 
3. Higher Customer Satisfaction – Continuous client involvement builds trust. 
 Example: Providing a demo version to the client every two weeks. 
4. Risk Reduction – Problems are discovered early before they escalate. 
 Example: Fixing database conflicts in an early sprint. 
5. Enhanced Team Motivation & Productivity – Collaborative work increases 
commitment. 
 Example: The team plans and executes tasks independently. 
6. Continuous Visibility of Progress – Clear tracking of project status at all 
times. 
 Example: Using a Kanban board to monitor daily tasks. 
 
 

 
Agile outside software development: Find two other fields where Agile is 
used (such as marketing, education, construction) and explain how it is 
applied 
 
1. Marketing 
• How Agile is applied in marketing: 
o Marketing teams use Agile to organize campaigns faster and respond 
more effectively to market changes. 
o Projects are divided into short sprints, usually weekly or biweekly. 
o Teams focus on testing small campaigns and analyzing results 
before launching bigger campaigns, reducing risk and increasing 
budget efficiency. 
o Daily meetings (Daily Stand-ups) help track progress and quickly 
resolve obstacles. 
• Example: Testing a new social media ad for a week, then adjusting the 
message or design based on performance before a full-scale launch. 
 
2. Construction / Engineering Projects 
• How Agile is applied in construction: 
o Large construction projects are divided into small phases similar to 
sprints (e.g., foundation, structure, finishing). 
o Teams of engineers, architects, and contractors work closely and 
review results regularly. 
o Flexibility is key: If client requirements change or technical problems 
arise, project plans can be adjusted without delaying the whole 
schedule. 
o Regular meetings and continuous evaluation reduce costly errors and 
increase client satisfaction. 
• Example: A construction team delivers the ground floor first to test the 
design, then continues with the remaining floors while fixing any issues 
discovered. 

How can Agile principles be applied to geographically distributed teams? What 
tools help, and what are the specific challenges 
️Key Agile Practices for Distributed Teams 
• Continuous Communication: Daily stand-ups via Zoom/Teams; record 
meetings for different time zones. 
• Transparency & Visibility: Digital Kanban/Scrum boards to track progress. 
• Task Management: Keep Product and Sprint Backlogs updated digitally. 
• Interactive Meetings: Sprint Planning, Review, and Retrospective using tools 
that allow real-time participation. 
• Collaboration: Pair programming, code reviews, and real-time document 
sharing. 
Useful Tools 
• Project Management: Jira, Trello, Asana 
• Communication: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack 
• Collaboration & Documentation: Confluence, Notion, Google Workspace 
• Visual Collaboration: Miro, MURAL, Figma 
Challenges & Solutions 
• Time Zone Differences: Rotate meeting times, record sessions. 
• Reduced Personal Interaction: Virtual coffee breaks, short video chats. 
• Building Trust & Team Spirit: Remote team-building activities, sharing 
successes regularly. 
• Limited Non-Verbal Communication: Use video and clear written notes. 
• Different Tools or Technology: Standardize the tool stack across the team. 
   Focus: Effective communication, transparency, and continuous delivery. 
 

 Agile is not a magic solution" – Identify three common criticisms of 
Agile, analyze them objectively, and explain when Agile might not be 
suitable.
 1. Lack of Long-Term Planning 
.

 • Criticism: Agile emphasizes iterative development and continuous delivery 
instead of comprehensive upfront planning, which may reduce long-term 
visibility of the project. 
• Objective Analysis: 
o Pros: Agile allows teams to quickly adapt to changing customer 
requirements and reduces risks associated with rigid plans. 
o Cons: In highly complex projects or regulated industries, the lack of 
detailed long-term planning can cause scheduling or compliance 
issues. 
2. High Dependence on Skilled Teams 
• Criticism: Agile assumes that teams are highly skilled, autonomous, and 
capable of making fast decisions, which can be challenging for inexperienced 
or poorly coordinated teams. 
• Objective Analysis: 
o Pros: Skilled teams can innovate quickly and continuously improve the 
product. 
o Cons: Less experienced or heterogeneous teams may struggle to 
follow Agile principles, leading to delays or chaos. 
3. Difficulty Estimating Time and Cost 
• Criticism: The iterative nature of Agile makes it hard to predict exact 
timelines and costs, which can be problematic for stakeholders or projects 
with fixed budgets. 
• Objective Analysis: 
o Pros: Agile provides flexibility in resource allocation and reduces waste 
on non-essential features. 
o Cons: In projects with strict budgets or contracts, inaccurate 
estimations may result in cost overruns or missed deadlines. 
When Might Agile Not Be Suitable? 
1. Projects with fixed and well-defined requirements (e.g., financial or legal 
systems). 
2. Projects with strict time or budget constraints. 
3. Teams that are not autonomous or lack experience in self-organized 
collaboration. 
4. Highly regulated environments that require extensive documentation and strict 
compliance (e.g., healthcare, aviation, defense).
