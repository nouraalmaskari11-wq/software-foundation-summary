1. What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)? 
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that defines the 
stages of developing software, including planning, analysis, design, development, testing, 
implementation, and maintenance. 
 Its main goal is to produce high-quality software that meets user requirements, within time 
and budget constraints. 
 
Importance of SDLC 
• Ensures quality and reliability of software. 
• Helps manage time, cost, and risks effectively. 
• Defines clear roles and responsibilities for team members. 
• Ensures the system meets user needs and is easy to maintain. 
 
Why It’s Used in Modern Projects 
Modern software projects are complex and dynamic. SDLC provides a systematic and 
flexible framework (like Agile models) that helps teams collaborate efficiently, adapt to 
changing requirements, and maintain consistent quality.

during development. 
   
 
   
 
 Testing - Fix defects identified by the QA team. - Support QA in testing complex functionalities. - Optimize performance based on test results. 
 Implementation / 
Deployment - Deploy the system to the production environment. - Support the technical team in resolving issues during 
deployment. - Ensure all system components function correctly after 
release. 
 Maintenance - Apply patches and updates. - Improve system performance and fix unexpected errors. - Develop new features based on user feedback. - Update technical documentation for future maintenance. 
 
  
   
 SDLC Analysis for a Food Delivery App 
Analysis 
• Goal: Gather and understand user and stakeholder requirements. 
• Concrete Examples: 
o Interview customers to determine needs: online payment, order tracking, 
restaurant ratings. 
o Interview restaurants to understand their requirements: menu management, 
order acceptance, promotions. 
o Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document to clearly 
define all functionalities. 
Design 
• Goal: Convert requirements into system architecture and user interface designs. 
• Concrete Examples: 
o Design user interface for the customer: login screen, restaurant list, checkout 
page, order tracking. 
o Database design: tables for users, orders, restaurants, and drivers. 
o Infrastructure design: backend server, APIs, integration with payment 
gateways and Google Maps. 
Development 
• Goal: Build the application according to the design. 
• Concrete Examples: 
o Develop mobile apps for iOS and Android using Flutter or React Native. 
o Build the backend with Node.js or Python to handle order processing. 
o Integrate payment gateways and connect the system with Google Maps for 
driver tracking. 
   
 
   
 
Testing 
• Goal: Ensure the app works correctly and meets user requirements. 
• Concrete Examples: 
o Functional testing: login, restaurant search, checkout, order tracking. 
o Performance testing: app load times, server capacity to handle thousands of 
orders. 
o Security testing: protect user and payment data. 
Implementation / Deployment 
• Goal: Launch the application for real users. 
• Concrete Examples: 
o Publish the app on App Store and Google Play. 
o Connect the system with restaurants and drivers. 
o Train the support team to handle user issues. 
o  
Maintenance 
• Goal: Continuously improve the app and fix issues after release. 
• Concrete Examples: 
o Update the app to fix bugs and improve performance. 
o Add new features: promotions, multi-language support, improved order 
tracking. 
o Optimize the database and server infrastructure to support more users. 
 
 
 
  
Timeline for a 6-Month Software Project 
Phase Duration Justification 
Analysis 4 weeks Gathering clear requirements from users and 
stakeholders to avoid misunderstandings. 
Design 4 weeks Designing UI, database, and infrastructure 
reduces issues during development. 
Development 12 weeks Coding all components, developing mobile 
apps and backend services. 
Testing 3 weeks Testing functionality, performance, security, 
and user experience to ensure quality. 
Implementation / 
Deployment 
1 week Launching the app on platforms and 
connecting with restaurants and drivers. 
Maintenance On going after 
release 
Fixing bugs, implementing improvements, and 
adding new features after users start using the 
app. 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Analysis Phase 
• Key Tasks: Gather requirements from users and stakeholders, and document clear 
system specifications. 
• Negative Impact if Ignored or Poorly Executed: 
o Unclear or incomplete requirements: Leads to building unnecessary 
features or missing essential ones. 
o Increased cost and time: Developers may need to redo code or redesign 
the system to meet actual requirements. 
o Low user satisfaction: The final product may not meet users’ needs. 
• Real Example: 
   
 
   
 
o A food delivery app is developed without properly analyzing restaurant needs. 
Result: restaurants cannot update menus easily, causing customer 
complaints and reduced app usage. 
 
2. Testing Phase 
• Key Tasks: Ensure the system works correctly, performs well, and is secure. 
• Negative Impact if Ignored or Poorly Executed: 
o Frequent software bugs: Application crashes or data loss during use. 
o Performance issues: Slow app response or failures under high load. 
o Security problems: User data leaks or system breaches. 
• Real Example: 
o Launching a new banking app without sufficient testing. Result: users face 
login issues, failed payments, and loss of trust in the platform. 
 
 Why it’s the longest and most costly: 
• Lasts throughout the software’s lifetime. 
• Fixing post-release bugs is more expensive than during development. 
   
 
   
 
• Adding features, improving performance, and ensuring compatibility with new 
devices/OS increases costs. 
• Example: Banking app needs updates for OS changes, security patches, and bug 
fixes. 
Types of Maintenance: 
1. Corrective: Fixing bugs. 
a. Example: Payment errors corrected after release. 
2. Adaptive: Updating for new environments. 
a. Example: App updated for latest iOS/Android. 
3. Perfective/Enhancement: Improving features or performance. 
a. Example: Adding restaurant ratings in a food delivery app. 
4. Preventive: Prevent future issues. 
a. Example: Optimizing database to handle more users. 
 
 
 
  
   
 
   
  
The Role of AI and Automation in SDLC 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation are increasingly used to improve software quality, 
speed up processes, and reduce human errors in the Software Development Life Cycle 
(SDLC). They can be applied in several phases, including: 
 
1. Analysis Phase 
• AI Role: 
o Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and analyze user 
requirements from texts, emails, and conversations. 
o Automatically detecting inconsistencies or ambiguities in system 
requirements. 
• Examples: Tools like IBM DOORS help convert user feedback and emails into clear 
system requirements. 
 
2. Testing Phase 
• AI & Automation Role: 
o Automatically generating tests to cover as many scenarios as possible. 
o Predicting the most likely defects based on past error patterns. 
• Examples: Tools like Selenium and Test.ai use AI to identify UI elements and 
create automated test cases. 
 
Benefits: 
• Reduces human errors. 
• Speeds up analysis and testing. 
• Improves the quality of the final product.
