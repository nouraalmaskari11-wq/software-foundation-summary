1. Responsibilities of Front-end, Back-end, and Database
Front-End (Client-Side)

The front-end is what users see and interact with in a web application.

Responsibilities

UI/UX Rendering: Build user interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or frameworks).

Client-Side Logic: Handle user interactions such as form validation, navigation, animations.

API Consumption: Send/receive data from back-end via HTTP (REST APIs, GraphQL).

Responsive Design: Ensure the app works on different devices and screen sizes.

Performance Optimization: Improve load times, caching, bundling, compressing images/files.

Accessibility: Make the website usable for all users (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

Back-End (Server-Side)

The back-end handles the logic, operations, and data processing of the web application.

Responsibilities

Application Logic: Handle business rules (authentication, payments, processing requests).

API Development: Create endpoints to send/receive data from front-end.

User Authentication & Authorization

Data Manipulation: Create, read, update, delete data (CRUD).

Security: Protect data, handle encryption, input validation, prevent attacks (XSS, SQL injection).

Integration: Communicate with databases, services, external APIs.

Database

A database stores application data in a structured or semi-structured format.

Responsibilities

Data Storage & Retrieval: Store persistent data (users, products, transactions).

Data Integrity: Enforce rules (constraints, validation, relationships).

Backup & Recovery

Query Optimization

Concurrency Management: Handle multiple simultaneous users.

Security: Control access, encryption, role-based permissions.

⚙️ 2. Explanation of .NET Stack Tools
1. SQL Server

A relational database management system (RDBMS) by Microsoft.

Key Features

Uses T-SQL (Transact-SQL) for queries.

Supports stored procedures, triggers, and views.

High performance and secure.

Works seamlessly with .NET applications.

Ideal for enterprise-level systems.

2. C# (C Sharp)

A modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.

Key Features

Compiled, strongly typed, high-performance language.

Multi-paradigm: OOP, functional, asynchronous.

Used for web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, cloud, AI, games (Unity).

Runs on the .NET runtime.

3. EF Core (Entity Framework Core)

An Object–Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET applications.

What It Does

Lets developers interact with the database using C# classes instead of SQL.

Automatically generates SQL queries.

Simplifies CRUD operations.

Supports migrations (schema changes via code).

Advantages

Faster development (no manual SQL).

Strong typing and compile-time checking.

Database-agnostic (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).

4. LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

A querying syntax integrated into C#. Allows querying:

Collections

Objects

Databases (via EF Core)

XML

JSON

Key Features

SQL-like syntax inside C#.

Strongly typed and compile-time checked.

Highly readable.

Example:

var results = users.Where(u => u.Age > 18).ToList();

5. Blazor

A web UI framework by Microsoft for building interactive web apps using C# instead of JavaScript.

Types of Blazor

Blazor Server: Executes on server; communicates via SignalR.

Blazor WebAssembly: Runs C# in the browser via WebAssembly.

Advantages

Full-stack development using C# only.

No JavaScript is required.

Reusable components.

Summary

Front-end handles UI, user interaction, and visuals.

Back-end processes logic, APIs, and communication with the database.

Database stores structured information and ensures data integrity.

The .NET stack includes powerful tools like C#, SQL Server, EF Core, LINQ, and Blazor, ideal for enterprise development.

C#, Java, and Python each have different strengths, with C# and Java leading in performance, and Python dominating data science.
